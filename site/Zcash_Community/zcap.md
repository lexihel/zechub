The Zcash Community Advisory Panel, or ZCAP, is a panel conformed by members of the Zcash Community, established as a means to involve the community and soliciting their advisory input whenever the Zcash Foundation needs to make a decision involving or afecting said community.

Since it's creation in 2018, the panel has helped define the way to go for the Zcash foundation in many important decisions, like the appointment of the Zcash Foundation Board of Directors, wether Zcash should move to an ASIC-resistant consensus algorithm, stablishing the Developers Fund and the Zcash Community Grants program and, also, the election of the Zcash Community Grants comittee.

The idea behind ZCAP is that it is formed by a diverse group of community members with different nationalities, roles and opinions, to guarantee it remains comitted to its goal of representing the voice and interest of Zcash users and stake holders, while maintining an open and diverse network.

As of october of 2023 ZCAP is formed by 188 members, and it is expanded frequently. Also, the Zcash Foundation has "expanded the eligibility criteria for ZCAP membership, including criteria that were suggested by members of the Zcash community".
